Sleep Schedule is a really tough phase young minds can't handle and we know how it feels to roam around in blue eyes so we have started this project called **Sleepium** Which can help people meditate and read helpful articles to get good and sound sleep .
Getting enough sleep is essential for helping a person maintain optimal health and well-being. When it comes to their health, sleep is as vital as regular exercise and eating a balanced diet.

## What it does
It gathers all the helpful and important articles to help people get a great sleep 
Some general healthful sleep habits may also help promote better sleep overall, including:

avoiding blue lights, such as smartphones or computers near bedtime
keeping the room as dark as possible by shutting windows and turning off lights from alarm clocks
avoiding caffeine later in the day
avoiding big meals before bedtime
reducing stress
setting a sleep schedule and trying to fall asleep at the same time each night

 <h1> Why should we throw some light on this topic ?ðŸŒƒðŸŒ›ðŸŒšðŸ’¤ </h1>

* Early school starts can cause adolescents to wake up earlier than they naturally would otherwise. During puberty, adolescents become sleepy later in the evening. However, they may still wake up early and miss valuable hours of sleep. Sleep deprivation in adolescents is linked to substance abuse, poor academic performance and being overweight. 
<br>

*  Sleep disorders such as restless legs syndrome, sleep apnea or hypersomnia can also disturb the circadian rhythm. As adults age, they also become more at risk for insomnia. As a result, they may struggle to fall asleep or may wake up too early. Insomnia and other sleep disorders can have long-term health effects and impact your daily cognitive, physical and emotional function.

## How we built it
We have used Html CSS And JS to build this website.
The Background is created on Canva

## Challenges we ran into
I created this project alone so I wasn't able to add many contents to it . Additionally The users have no age limit thus the website is for All age groups and All genders.

## What's next for Sleepium ðŸŒƒðŸŒ›ðŸŒšðŸ’¤
I'll be working more on the backend of Sleepium to convert it into a running Sleep Scheduler
